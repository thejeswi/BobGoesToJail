 shall automatically lead to the person being subject to supervision.The

public authority shall not be credited to the period. The court shall 
order its enforcement if the purpose of the measure still so requires. 
If the purpose of the measure has not been achieved, yet special 
circumstances justify the expectation that it may be achieved by a

detention. If a custodial measure is enforced before a sentence of 
imprisonment imposed at the same time, the maximum period shall be 
extended by the length of the term of imprisonment to the extent the

 If no maximum period has been provided or the period has not yet 
expired, the court shall suspend the measure for an operational 
probationary period if it can be expected that the person subject to the
 measure will not commitany more unlawful acts if released. The order 
for suspension shall automatically lead to the person being subjected to
 supervision. The same shall apply mutatis mutandis if the court, after 
enforcement of the incapacitation order has begun, finds that its 
further enforcement would be disproportionate, because the detainee was 
not offered sufficient care within the meaning of section 66c(1) No 1 
before a period set by the court not exceeding six months has elapsed; 
such a period shall be set by the court when reviewing the suspension of
 the enforcement, unless sufficient care is offered, indicating the 
measures to be offered. The suspension under the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> sentences shall automatically lead to the person being subject to supervision.</p><p><a name="p0494"><!----></a>(3)
 If ten years of an incapacitation order have been served, the court

resulting in serious emotional trauma or physical injury to the victims.
 The order for release shall automatically lead to the person being 
subject to supervision.</p><p><a name="p0495"><!----></a>(4) If the

 If, after the enforcement of a mental hospital order has begun, the

supervision if it can be expected that the person will not commit any 
further offences without it.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/index.html#gl_p0498">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0498"><!----></a>Section 67e<br>Review</p><p><a name="p0499"><!----></a>(1)

 to avert the danger posed by the offender. If the offender has no

 to a claim of the victim the satisfaction of which would deprive the

obtained.</p><p><a name="p0644"><!----></a>(2) The order of confiscation
 shall extend to benefits derived from what was obtained. It may also 
extend to objects which the principal or secondary participant has

the assumption that these objects were acquired as a result of unlawful 
acts, or for the purpose of committing them. The 1st sentence shall also

 The counselling serves to protect unborn life. It should be guided by 
efforts to encourage the woman to continue the pregnancy and to open her
 to the prospects of a life with the child; it should help her to make a
 responsible and conscientious decision. The woman must thereby be aware
 that the unborn child has its own right to life with respect to her at 
every stage of the pregnancy and that a termination of pregnancy can 
therefore only be considered under the law in exceptional situations, 
when carrying the child to term would give rise to a burden for the 
woman which is so serious and extraordinary that it exceeds the 
reasonable limits of sacrifice. The counselling should, through advice 
and assistance, contribute to overcoming the conflict situation which 
exists in connection with the pregnancy and remedying an emergency 
situation. Further details shall be regulated by the Act on Pregnancies 
in Conflict Situations.</p><p><a name="p1843"><!----></a>(2) The 
counselling must take place pursuant to the Act on Pregnancies in 
Conflict Situations through a recognised pregnancy conflict counselling 
agency. After the conclusion of the counselling on the subject, the 
counselling agency must issue the pregnant woman with a certificate 
including the date of the last counselling session and the name of the 
pregnant woman in accordance with the Act on Pregnancies in Conflict 
Situations. The physician who performs the termination of pregnancy is

acted or where, according to his intention, the offence should have been
 committed. If the secondary participant to an offence committed abroad 
acted within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, German

 If the offender, pursuant to a law according to which section 43a is

 If one of the sentences for the individual offences is imprisonment for

In all other cases the aggregate sentence shall be fixed by increasing 
the most severe individual sentence incurred and, in the case of 
different kinds of penalties, by increasing the sentence that is most 
severe in nature. The person of the offender and the individual offences
 shall be considered in their totality.</p><p><a name="p0291"><!----></a>(2)
 The aggregate sentence shall be less than the sum of the individual 
sentences. It shall not, in the case of imprisonment for a fixed term, 
exceed fifteen years, in the case of a confiscatory expropriation order,
 the value of the offender's assets, and in the case of a fine, seven

those proceedings in which the factual findings underlying the new

 Confiscatory expropriation orders, ancillary penalties and measures 
(section 11(1) No 8) imposed in the previous sentence shall be upheld to

 If a person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one

probationary period if there are reasons to believe that the sentence 
will serve as s sufficient warning to the convicted person and that he 
will commit no further offences without having to serve the sentence. 
The court shall particularly take into account the character of the 
convicted person, his previous history, the circumstances of his 
offence, his conduct after the offence, his circumstances and the

 the harm caused by the offence.</p><p><a name="p0300"><!----></a>(3) 
The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment exceeding six months shall
 not be suspended when reasons of general deterrence so require.</p><p><a name="p0301"><!----></a>(4)

 Whosoever terminates a pregnancy in cases under section 218a(2) or (3) 
without having received the written determination of a physician, who 
did not himself perform the termination of the pregnancy, as to whether 
the conditions of section 218a(2) or (3) were met shall be liable to 
imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine unless the offence is

section 218a(2) or (3) for presentation under the 1st sentence above

 A physician must not make determinations pursuant to section 218a(2) or

has been convicted by final judgment for an unlawful act under 
subsection (1) or under section 218, section 219a or section 219b or for
 another unlawful act which he committed in connection with a 
termination of pregnancy. The competent agency may provisionally 
prohibit a physician from making determinations under section 218a(2)

 The counselling serves to protect unborn life. It should be guided by 
efforts to encourage the woman to continue the pregnancy and to open her
 to the prospects of a life with the child; it should help her to make a
 responsible and conscientious decision. The woman must thereby be aware
 that the unborn child has its own right to life with respect to her at 
every stage of the pregnancy and that a termination of pregnancy can 
therefore only be considered under the law in exceptional situations, 
when carrying the child to term would give rise to a burden for the 
woman which is so serious and extraordinary that it exceeds the 
reasonable limits of sacrifice. The counselling should, through advice 
and assistance, contribute to overcoming the conflict situation which 
exists in connection with the pregnancy and remedying an emergency 
situation. Further details shall be regulated by the Act on Pregnancies 
in Conflict Situations.</p><p><a name="p1843"><!----></a>(2) The 
counselling must take place pursuant to the Act on Pregnancies in 
Conflict Situations through a recognised pregnancy conflict counselling 
agency. After the conclusion of the counselling on the subject, the 
counselling agency must issue the pregnant woman with a certificate 
including the date of the last counselling session and the name of the 
pregnant woman in accordance with the Act on Pregnancies in Conflict 
Situations. The physician who performs the termination of pregnancy is 
excluded from being a counsellor.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/index.html#gl_p1844">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1844"><!----></a>Section 219a<br>Advertising services for abortion</p><p><a name="p1845"><!----></a>(1)
